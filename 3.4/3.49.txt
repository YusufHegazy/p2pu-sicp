Here's a contrived example: you rent a movie, but back home it turns out
that it's a sequel. You keep the movie and next day you go back to rentals 
to get the prequel. In the meantime I have rented the prequel and learned
that it has a sequel. I want to watch both in one sitting, so I try to get
the sequel also. We both keep the part we have already secured in the hopes
that we get the other part soon. If there's only one of each, the situation
doesn't resolve by itself and we could wait forever, if it wouldn't get
expensive. To break the deadlock, one of us should back out and return the
movie, or we could contact each other and negotiate, who gets to watch
both parts first. Even better, we could watch them together!
